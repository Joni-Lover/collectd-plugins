 - messages
 - messages_rate
 - messages_unacknolwedged
 - messages_unacknolwedged_rate
 - messages_ready
 - message_ready_rate
 - memory
 - consumers
 - publish
 - publish_rate
 - deliver_no_ack
 - deliver_no_ack_rate

 - deliver_get_rate

Refer to the RabbitMQ documentation for details on the meanings of these metrics.

You'll need to add an entry to /usr/share/collectd/types.db that will look like:
rabbitmq messages:GAUGE:0:U,messages_rate:GAUGE:0:U,messages_unacknolwedged:GAUGE:0:U,messages_unacknowledged_rate:GAUGE:0:U,messages_ready:GAUGE:0:U,message_ready_rate:GAUGE:0:U,memory:GAUGE:0:U,consumers:GAUGE:0:U,publish:GAUGE:0:U,publish_rate:GAUGE:0:U,deliver_no_ack:GAUGE:0:U,deliver_no_ack_rate:GAUGE:0:U,deliver_get:GAUGE:0:U,deliver_get_rate:GAUGE:0:U
